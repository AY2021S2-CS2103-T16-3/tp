##Introduction<br>
* ResidenceTracker is a command line based desktop application that helps landlords to manage their residences that they rented out.

* It provides convenience to the user by providing a centralised overview of all his/her residences and their respective booking/cleaning statuses. 

* It uses a **quick CLI** way to note down bookings and track status of different residence
  (clean/occupied/needs cleaning...) , so the landlord can process booking in time and inform the cleaning agent as necessary.

* It is **written in OOP fashion**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
