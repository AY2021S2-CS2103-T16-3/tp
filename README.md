## About ResidenceTracker
ResidenceTracker is a CLI-driven, personal desktop management app that assists landlords in managing multiple residences that are rented out on Airbnb platform.

With ResidenceTracker, landlords can note down bookings across multiple residences swiftly. Additionally, ResidenceTracker enables the status of different residences, such as whether a residence is cleaned or requires cleaning, occupied or booked etc., to be tracked with ease.

Thus, landlords can now better process bookings across multiple residences and inform the cleaning agent as necessary, reducing time spent on managing their residences on traditional desktop apps like Microsoft Excel.
